    <h2>Welcome to The Learning Institute.</h2>
    
    <p>
      By using our tutoring services, both online and in person, you agree to
      the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully:
      <p />
      <p>
        1. <b>Information Sharing</b> The Learning Institute may share relevant
        information provided during the enrollment process with teachers
        assigned to the student. This ensures a personalized and effective
        educational experience.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        {" "}
        2. <b>Additional Service</b> Fee To ensure comprehensive support and quality
        service, The Learning Institute incorporates an additional 20% fee.
        This covers essential aspects such as planning time, provision of
        resources, report writing, and assessments. This fee reflects our
        commitment to delivering a thorough educational experience with care
        and consideration.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        3. <b>Recording of Sessions</b> All tutoring sessions, both online and in
        person, will be recorded for safeguarding purposes. These recordings
        are stored securely and confidentially in a centralized location for
        the duration of the tuition cycle. Once the tuition cycle is complete,
        the recordings will be permanently deleted. This practice ensures the
        safety of all parties involved while maintaining strict
        confidentiality.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        4. <b>Cancellation and Punctuality Policy</b> Our teachers meticulously
        arrange their schedules to ensure attendance and preparation for each
        session. We request a minimum of 24 hours&#39; notice for
        cancellations to accommodate changes efficiently. If a cancellation
        occurs with less than 24 hours&#39; notice, a nominal fee equivalent
        to the full lesson amount may be applied. This policy helps us uphold
        the quality and continuity of our educational services while
        respecting the dedication of our educators.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        5. <b>Refund Policy</b> The Learning Institute is dedicated to delivering
        high-quality tutoring and ensuring student and customer satisfaction.
        If you are dissatisfied with your initial tutoring session, you may
        claim a full refund. This applies only to the first session and must
        be claimed within 24 hours of the session&#39;s conclusion.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        6. <b>Confidentiality and Data Protection</b> (GDPR Compliance) We take your
        privacy seriously and adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation
        (GDPR). All personal information and recorded sessions are treated
        with strict confidentiality and stored securely. Information collected
        will only be used for the purpose of providing tutoring services and
        will not be shared with unauthorized parties. You have the right to
        access, rectify, or delete your personal data at any time. For any
        data protection inquiries, please contact our Data Protection Officer
        at [contact email].
