        Terms and Conditions
Welcome to The Learning Institute. By using our tutoring services, both online
and in person, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read
them carefully:
1. Information Sharing
The Learning Institute may share relevant information provided during the
enrollment process with teachers assigned to the student. This ensures a
personalized and effective educational experience.
2. Additional Service Fee
To ensure comprehensive support and quality service, The Learning
Institute incorporates an additional 20% fee. This covers essential aspects
such as planning time, provision of resources, report writing, and assessments.
This fee reflects our commitment to delivering a thorough educational
experience with care and consideration.
3. Recording of Sessions
All tutoring sessions, both online and in person, will be recorded for
safeguarding purposes. These recordings are stored securely and
confidentially in a centralized location for the duration of the tuition cycle.
Once the tuition cycle is complete, the recordings will be permanently deleted.
This practice ensures the safety of all parties involved while maintaining strict
confidentiality.
4. Cancellation and Punctuality Policy
Our teachers meticulously arrange their schedules to ensure attendance and
preparation for each session. We request a minimum of 24 hours&#39; notice for
cancellations to accommodate changes efficiently. If a cancellation occurs with
less than 24 hours&#39; notice, a nominal fee equivalent to the full lesson amount
may be applied. This policy helps us uphold the quality and continuity of our
educational services while respecting the dedication of our educators.
5. Refund Policy
The Learning Institute is dedicated to delivering high-quality tutoring and
ensuring student and customer satisfaction. If you are dissatisfied with your
initial tutoring session, you may claim a full refund. This applies only to the
first session and must be claimed within 24 hours of the session&#39;s conclusion.
6. Confidentiality and Data Protection (GDPR Compliance)
We take your privacy seriously and adhere to the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). All personal information and recorded sessions are
treated with strict confidentiality and stored securely. Information collected
