      <h2>Welcome to The Learning Institute.</h2>
      
      <p>
        By using our tutoring services, both online and in person, you agree to
        the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully:
        <p />
        <p>
          1. <b>Information Sharing</b> The Learning Institute may share relevant
          information provided during the enrollment process with teachers
          assigned to the student. This ensures a personalised and effective
          educational experience.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          {" "}
          2. <b>Additional Service</b> Fee To ensure comprehensive support and quality
          service, The Learning Institute incorporates an additional 20% fee.
          This covers essential aspects such as planning time, provision of
          resources, report writing, and assessments. This fee reflects our
          commitment to delivering a thorough educational experience with care
          and consideration.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          3. <b>Recording of Sessions</b> All tutoring sessions, both online and in
          person, will be recorded for safeguarding purposes. These recordings
          are stored securely and confidentially in a centralised location for
          the duration of the tuition cycle. Once the tuition cycle is complete,
          the recordings will be permanently deleted. This practice ensures the
          safety of all parties involved while maintaining strict
          confidentiality.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          4. <b>Cancellation and Punctuality Policy</b> Our teachers meticulously
          arrange their schedules to ensure attendance and preparation for each
          session. We request a minimum of 24 hours&#39; notice for
          cancellations to accommodate changes efficiently. If a cancellation
          occurs with less than 24 hours&#39; notice, a nominal fee equivalent
          to the full lesson amount may be applied. This policy helps us uphold
          the quality and continuity of our educational services while
          respecting the dedication of our educators.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          5. <b>Refund Policy</b> The Learning Institute is dedicated to delivering
          high-quality tutoring and ensuring student and customer satisfaction.
          If you are dissatisfied with your initial tutoring session, you may
          claim a full refund. This applies only to the first session and must
          be claimed within 24 hours of the session&#39;s conclusion.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          6. <b>Confidentiality and Data Protection</b> (GDPR Compliance) We take your
          privacy seriously and adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation
          (GDPR). All personal information and recorded sessions are treated
          with strict confidentiality and stored securely. Information collected
          will only be used for the purpose of providing tutoring services and
          will not be shared with unauthorised parties. You have the right to
          access, rectify, or delete your personal data at any time. For any
          data protection inquiries, please contact our Data Protection Officer
          at [info@learning-institute.co.uk].
